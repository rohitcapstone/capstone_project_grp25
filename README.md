The Tour Guide Chatbot is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to enhance tourist experiences by providing real-time information about landmarks, directions, events, and local services. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) through Googleâ€™s Dialogflow, this chatbot interacts with users in a conversational manner, answering queries about tourist destinations, offering historical facts, and providing walking directions between points of interest. The chatbot integrates multiple external APIs such as Google Maps, Foursquare, OpenWeather, and Wikipedia, allowing it to offer personalized suggestions for nearby attractions, weather updates, and contextual information about landmarks.
The project is built using Node.js as the backend to manage API interactions and user sessions, making it highly scalable and capable of handling a wide range of user requests. The chatbot can be deployed across multiple platforms, including websites and messaging services, providing tourists with easy access to information at any time. Its flexible architecture allows for future expansion to include voice-based interaction, event ticketing, and advanced recommendation features, making it a comprehensive digital tour guide.
