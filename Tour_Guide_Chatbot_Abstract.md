The Tour Guide Chatbot is an interactive web-based application designed to assist tourists by providing real-time weather updates and location-based services. It integrates APIs like OpenWeather API for weather forecasts and Google Maps API for map-based location recommendations. The chatbot features a user-friendly interface where users can type queries and receive dynamic, personalized responses.

The project involves the following key components:

Frontend Design:

HTML defines the chatbot’s structure, including a chat window and input field.
CSS ensures a responsive and visually appealing interface.
JavaScript enables real-time user interaction and API integration.
Backend Integration:

OpenWeather API fetches weather data based on user-inputted city names.
Google Maps API generates clickable map links for queried locations.
Functionality:
